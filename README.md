To DEMO the app for yourself, Click Here: https://loganveik.github.io/marvelproject/

App Description:
This app uses html5, css, bootstrap, javascript, Jquery, and the API from https://marvel.com

The app starts you at the home screen, where you can choose to either search a Marvel character or a comicbook. Both do the same thing, except one is searching the character API, and the other is searching the comic API.
